# Changelog

All notable changes to the **LITS API contract** are recorded here. The format follows
[Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/). The contract is versioned in the URL
path (`/v1`); see [CONTRIBUTING.md](./CONTRIBUTING.md) for the change policy.

## [Unreleased]

First public draft of the open LITS contract. Current surface:

- **Client API** (`openapi.yaml`): `POST /v1/animals`, `GET /v1/animals/{national_id}`,
  `POST /v1/movements`, `POST /v1/vaccinations`, `POST /v1/certificates` (request),
  `GET /v1/certificates/{id}`, `POST /v1/certificates/{id}/revoke`, `GET /v1/zones` (delta sync),
  `GET /v1/verify/{token}` (public, no auth), `GET /healthz`. Per-operator bearer auth,
  `Idempotency-Key` on writes, acknowledgement IDs on every response.
- **Control-plane API** (`openapi-admin.yaml`): zone authoring, integrator accreditation and
  API-key management, certificate issue/revoke, movement transitions, and audit.
- Sample payloads (`examples/`), a contract validator (`scripts/validate.py`), and the
  conformance approach (`conformance/`).

The contract is `*-draft` and may change without a version bump until `1.0.0` is ratified with
the competent authority (see [CONTRIBUTING.md](./CONTRIBUTING.md)).
